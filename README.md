# FMZshConfig

This is a repo that I made for my own

Here I store configuration files for ZSH modified by me to my needs, as well as the results of experiments with the ZSH syntax

## Whai I have to do

Actually, I don't know. Really. This repo is just a storage for my experiments in zsh scripting.

So where is no roadmap

## License

I really don't know if I need a license, but I used some things under license agreement, so I desided to write my own. You can find this [here](LICENSE) This license obliges you only to comply with the licenses of the components I use, otherwise there are no requirements or restrictions.
